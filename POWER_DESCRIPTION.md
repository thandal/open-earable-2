# Power Management — OpenEarable v2

## Context

This started as a **code review / analysis** of the firmware's power-management
strategy. Most of the §0 "target design" has now been implemented; issues
called out in §3 that have been resolved are marked with ✅. The document is
still part description of how things work today, part list of known issues.

## 0. Boot sequence and load-switch lifecycle (as implemented)

### Hardware power rails (from schematic)

| Rail | Device | GPIO | Powers |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| **V_LS** (`ls_1_8`) | AP22118CA4-7 | `gpio1.11` | I2C2/I2C3 pull-ups, MX25R6435F flash VCC, SD card SPI level-shifter low side, sensors (1.8 V supply via connector) |
| **LS_LDO** (`ls_3_3`) | BQ25120A internal | `gpio0.14` | KTD2026 LED controller VIN, PPG LDO, sensors (3.3 V supply via connector), audio codec |
| **V_SD** (`ls_sd`) | AP22118CA4-7 | `gpio1.12` | SD card VDD, SD card SPI level-shifter high side |

**i2c1 pull-ups are on a permanent supply** (not V_LS). This is why
`PowerManager::begin` can talk to BQ25120A / BQ27220 / KTD2026 before any load
switch is up.

### Which rails each consumer needs

| Consumer | `ls_1_8` | `ls_3_3` | `ls_sd` | Notes |
|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|-------|
| Sensors (I2C3: BMA580, BMX160, BMP388, MLX90632) | **yes** | some | — | I2C3 pull-ups on V_LS; MLX90632/BMA580 also need 3.3 V |
| PPG (MAXM86161, I2C2) | **yes** | **yes** | — | I2C2 pull-ups on V_LS; PPG LDO on 3.3 V |
| Audio codec (ADAU1860, I2C2) | **yes** | — | — | I2C2 pull-ups on V_LS; codec enable via separate GPIO |
| LED controller (KTD2026, I2C1) | — | **yes** | — | I2C1 pull-ups on permanent supply; VIN needs 3.3 V |
| SPI NOR flash (MX25R6435F) | **yes** | — | — | VCC on V_LS; DFU only in the app |
| SD card (SDHC on SPI4) | **yes** | — | **yes** | Level-shifter needs V_LS (low) + V_SD (high) |
| BQ25120A / BQ27220 (I2C1) | — | — | — | Permanent supply |

### Idle profile (as implemented)

"Device on, BLE advertising, no sensors, no SD logging, no audio, no DFU" plus
a status LED flashing to indicate state:

- `ls_1_8`: **OFF** (unless an SD card is physically present → ON for level-shifter)
- `ls_3_3`: **ON** while LED is active (KTD2026 owns via `_get`/`_put`)
- `ls_sd`: **OFF** (unless an SD card is physically present → ON)

### Boot sequence

```
T=0   Reset

         └→ SYS_INIT init_load_switch (PRE_KERNEL_2, prio 80)
            ├→ gpio1.11 = HIGH  (ls_1_8 ON — needed for SPI NOR flash)
            └→ gpio0.14 = HIGH  (ls_3_3 ON — needed for status LED)
         └→ mcuboot reads/verifies image, blinks LED
         └→ mcuboot jumps to app  (GPIO state preserved: ls_1_8 HIGH, ls_3_3 HIGH)

         └→ init_pm_device(ls_sd):  gpio → INACTIVE (was already off)
         Framework state: all three SUSPENDED, refcount 0
      └→ spi_nor driver init (mx25r6435f)
         pm_device_driver_init checks pm_device_is_powered(dev):
           - power-domains = <&load_switch> → parent is SUSPENDED
           - pm_device_is_powered returns FALSE
           → pm_device_init_off(dev); return 0;
           NO SPI transactions. NO infinite-loop hang.
      └→ sdhc_spi driver init (sdhc0)
         Only checks device_is_ready(spi_dev). No SPI I/O. No hang.

      ├→ power_on = true, state_indicator.init → KTD2026::begin
      │  └→ _get(ls_3_3)  → RESUME → gpio HIGH → LED on
      ├→ Starts power_button_watch_work (see §8)
      └→ main() continues:
         ├→ sdcard_manager.init() → acquires ls_1_8 + ls_sd briefly, probes

         │    rails if card present, releases otherwise
         ├→ disk_access_init("SD") — SD disk initialised while rails are up
         ├→ usbd_enable — USB MSC LUN points at "SD"
         ├→ Sensors started later (BLE client configures)
         │  └→ sensor.init → _get(ls_1_8) [+ _get(ls_3_3) for some]
         ├→ Audio started later (streaming begins)
         │  └→ dac.begin → _get(ls_1_8)
         └→ DFU (MCUmgr upload over BLE)
            └→ StateIndicator DFU hook: MGMT_EVT_OP_IMG_MGMT_DFU_STARTED
                → _get(mx25r64) → cascades via power-domains to _get(ls_1_8)
                → TURN_ON: spi_nor_configure (JEDEC ID, SFDP, mxicy config)
                → RESUME: exit DPD → flash ready
            └→ MGMT_EVT_OP_IMG_MGMT_DFU_STOPPED
                → _put(mx25r64) → SUSPEND (enter DPD)
                → cascades _put(ls_1_8) → if refcount=0, SUSPEND → gpio LOW
```

### What was implemented

- **DTS** (`boards/openearable_v2_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay`,
  `.../openearable_v2_nrf5340_cpuapp_common.dts`):
  - `mx25r64` gets `power-domains = <&load_switch>` + `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto`.
  - All three load-switch nodes get `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto`.
  - The repo-local load-switch binding lives at
    `boards/teco/openearable_v2/dts/bindings/load-switch.yaml` and includes
    `#power-domain-cells = <0>` so other devices can declare it as their power domain.
- **Kconfig** (`prj.conf`): `CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_POWER_DOMAIN=y`.
- **`KTD2026.cpp`**: no longer claims `ls_1_8`; only `ls_3_3`.
- **`PowerManager::begin`**: claims no load switches. No per-reset-reason
  force-boot blocks; `check_battery()` is the only gate (see §2).
- **`SDCardManager::init`**: presence probe — briefly acquires `ls_1_8` + `ls_sd`,
  waits 1 ms, checks `sd_state` pin, keeps rails if a card is present, releases
  otherwise. Card-detect can't read the card unless rails are up (project memory:
  `project_sd_detect_needs_rails`). `aquire_ls` / `release_ls` only manage
  `ls_1_8` + `ls_sd`.
- **`main.cpp`**: calls `sdcard_manager.init()` before `disk_access_init("SD")`
  so the SD disk probe sees an already-powered card.
- **MCUmgr DFU hook** (`StateIndicator.cpp`): `MGMT_EVT_OP_IMG_MGMT_DFU_STARTED`
  calls `pm_device_runtime_get(mx25r64_dev)` and DFU_STOPPED calls the matching
  `_put`, cascading through power-domains to `ls_1_8`.

### Why the boot hang was fixed

The Zephyr `spi_nor` driver's `pm_device_driver_init` checks
`pm_device_is_powered(dev)`: with `CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_POWER_DOMAIN=y` and a
`power-domains` parent that's SUSPENDED, it returns false → `pm_device_init_off`
short-circuits the init before any SPI transaction. Without the power-domain
linkage the driver would read 0xFF from the unpowered chip and spin forever in
`spi_nor_wait_until_ready` (unbounded `while (true)` in `spi_nor.c:479`
because the WIP bit looks set in garbage).

---

## 1. Zephyr PM background (one-paragraph refresher)

Zephyr separates **System PM** (CPU sleep states, set by a policy callback during the
idle thread) from **Device PM** (per-driver action callbacks: `TURN_ON`, `RESUME`,
`SUSPEND`, `TURN_OFF`). Device Runtime PM (`CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME`) layers a
reference counter on top: drivers call `pm_device_runtime_get()` before using a device
and `pm_device_runtime_put()` after, and the framework calls the action callback to
flip ACTIVE↔SUSPENDED automatically. Devices can be tied together via the
`power-domains` DT property, so getting a child also brings up its supply, and the
`zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` DT property makes the framework enable runtime PM
without an explicit `pm_device_runtime_enable()` in code.

---

## 2. What OpenEarable v2 actually does

**Configuration** (`prj.conf:125-128`):
```
CONFIG_PM=y
CONFIG_PM_DEVICE=y
CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME=y
CONFIG_POWEROFF=y
```
System PM is *enabled* but no PM policy hooks or sleep states are exercised — the
application never participates in system suspend. The MCU only ever runs at full
clock or fully off (`sys_poweroff()`).

**Architecture in three layers:**

1. **Application policy — `PowerManager` (`src/Battery/PowerManager.{h,cpp}`)**
   - Custom 10-state battery/charging state machine fed by BQ27220 (fuel gauge) +
     BQ25120A (charger) over I²C1, driven by two work items
     (`charge_ctrl_delayable`, `fuel_gauge_work`) and three GPIO callbacks
     (`power_good_callback`, `fuel_gauge_callback`, `battery_controller_callback`).
     Classification is factored into a pure `classify_charging()` helper (§6).
   - Owns the boot/power-on/power-off sequence: `begin()` and `power_down()`.
   - Publishes battery state on the `battery_chan` ZBUS channel.

2. **Power gating — three custom load-switch "devices"**
   `boards/teco/openearable_v2/board_init.c` defines three `DEVICE_DT_DEFINE`s
   (`ls_1_8`, `ls_3_3`, `ls_sd`) using a generic PM control callback that just
   toggles a GPIO and waits `power-delay-us`:
   ```c
   case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_SUSPEND: gpio_pin_set_dt(&data->ctrl_pin, 0); break;
   case PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME : gpio_pin_set_dt(&data->ctrl_pin, 1);
                                  k_usleep(data->delay_us); break;
   ```
   The load switches use `pm_device_runtime_*` for refcounting. `ls_3_3` is the
   3.3 V LDO inside the BQ25120A (DT child of `bq25120a@6a`); `ls_1_8` and `ls_sd`
   are GPIO load switches on `gpio1.11` / `gpio1.12`. All three have
   `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` so runtime PM is enabled automatically and
   `PowerManager::begin()` doesn't have to touch them — each rail comes up on
   the first `_get` and drops on the last `_put`.

3. **Application-level sensor/peripheral wrappers**
   Every sensor driver (`IMU.cpp`, `Baro.cpp`, `BoneConduction.cpp`, `PPG.cpp`,
   `Temp.cpp`), the LED driver (`KTD2026.cpp`), the audio codec (`ADAU1860.cpp`),
   and the SD card manager (`SD_Card_Manager.cpp`) call
   `pm_device_runtime_get(ls_*)` in `init()`/`begin()` and
   `pm_device_runtime_put(ls_*)` in `stop()`/`power_off()`. None of the sensors
   themselves are real Zephyr devices — they're declared as
   `compatible = "i2c-device"` and accessed through C++ wrappers, so they have no
   PM action callbacks of their own.

**Power-down sequence (`PowerManager::power_down`):**

`reboot()` and `power_down()` share a `shutdown_subsystems()` helper that:
disconnects BLE peers, stops external advertising, stops the sensor manager,
stops the BT watchdog, and ends the DAC. From there:

1. `shutdown_subsystems()` (shared with `reboot()`)
2. `led_controller.power_off()`
3. If not charging: arm BQ25120A PG as the System-OFF wake source, high-impedance the charger
4. `k_msleep(200)` to let BT disconnects propagate, then `bt_disable()` (on nRF5340
   this also forces the netcore off via `bt_hci_transport_teardown`)
5. Clear error LED
6. If charging: `sys_reboot(COLD)` and return
7. Otherwise: disable BQ25120A `EN_LS_LDO`, then `pm_device_action_run(SUSPEND)` on
   `ls_sd`, `ls_3_3`, `ls_1_8`, and `cons` (the UART console)
8. `poweroff audit` log line (rail pins, `EN_LS_LDO`, `pmic_cd`, `netcore_off`)
9. `sys_poweroff()`; fallback `k_msleep(1000); sys_reboot(COLD)`

**Sensor pattern (typical):**
```cpp
bool Sensor::init() {
    pm_device_runtime_get(ls_1_8);   // and ls_3_3 if needed
    if (!hw.begin()) { pm_device_runtime_put(ls_1_8); return false; }
    ...
}
void Sensor::stop() {
    if (!_active) return;
    _active = false; _running = false;
    k_timer_stop(...); k_work_cancel(...);
    hw.softReset()/stop()/sleepMode();   // varies — see §3.4
    pm_device_runtime_put(ls_1_8);
}
```

## 3. Issues

### Critical

#### 3.1 No mid-power "BLE advertising only" state
During normal "idle" operation (advertising or connected) the BLE controller
(network core + RF) is the dominant power consumer. There is no
advertising-only / sensors-off mid-power state — the device is "everything on"
or "off". The 12 s power-on delay reported in `PROBLEMS.md` may also be
downstream of BLE init being slow. The **poweroff** path is handled — see §3.1a.

#### 3.1a `bt_disable()` in `power_down()` — works
Empirically tested on-device: `bt_disable()` returns 0 in ~234 ms and the audit
reports `netcore_off=1`. Code path: `bt_disable()` → HCI driver close hook →
`bt_hci_transport_teardown()` at `zephyr/drivers/bluetooth/hci/nrf53_support.c:23`
→ `nrf53_cpunet_enable(false)` → onoff refcount → 0 → `onoff_stop` callback
writes `NETWORK.FORCEOFF = Hold` via the HAL. Upstream Zephyr, not NCS-specific.
The old "crashes / doesn't wake up" comment in the source was stale and has
been removed. A 200 ms sleep before the call lets earlier `bt_conn_disconnect`
events propagate.

#### 3.2 No system PM is actually used
`CONFIG_PM=y` is set but the application never enters a low-power sleep state.
Zephyr's tickless idle reduces wakeups, but the SoC stays in CONSTLAT, the HF clock is
likely running, and the I²C peripheral blocks (see 3.6) are powered. There is no PM
policy callback, no `pm_state_force()`, no constraint API usage. The "low power" path
is jump-straight-to-`sys_poweroff()`.

#### 3.3 `power_down` re-initialises the LED controller before turning it off ✅ RESOLVED
`power_down()` now just calls `led_controller.power_off()` — the spurious
`led_controller.begin()` is gone.

#### 3.4 Sensors don't actually sleep before their rail is cut
Current state:

| Sensor          | Driver               | Pre-cut shutdown                          |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| BMX160 (IMU)    | `IMU.cpp:149-171`    | ✅ `imu.stop()` parks accel+gyro in `BMI160_*_SUSPEND_MODE` via `bmi160_set_sens_conf` |
| BMP388 (Baro)   | `Baro.cpp`           | ✅ `bmp.sleep()` now sets `BMP3_MODE_SLEEP` before the `_put` |
| BMA580 (Bone)   | `BoneConduction.cpp:140-153` | `bma580.stop()` (sets BMA5_REG_CMD_SUSPEND) ✓ |
| MAXM86161 (PPG) | `PPG.cpp:156-169`    | `ppg.stop()` (REG_SYSTEM_CONTROL shutdown bit) ✓ |
| MLX90632 (Temp) | `Temp.cpp`           | `temp.sleepMode()` ✓ |

All sensors now quiesce before their rail drops.

#### 3.5 PPG manually drives a GPIO LDO that is never released ✅ RESOLVED
`PPG.cpp` now hoists the LDO `gpio_dt_spec` to file scope and clears it in both
`init()`'s error path and `stop()` — the LDO is dropped before `ls_1_8`/`ls_3_3`
are released, and the refcount leak on the init error path is fixed.

#### 3.6 I²C buses are never gated
`i2c1`, `i2c2`, `i2c3` all have `status = "okay"` and define both `default` and
`sleep` pinctrl states (`*.dts:95-183`). But nothing ever drives the bus into the
sleep state — `nordic,nrf-twim` only flips pinctrl when its own PM action callback
runs, and nobody calls `pm_device_action_run` on the I²C controllers. So the TWIM
peripheral blocks are clocked continuously.

### High

#### 3.7 No `power-domains` linkage between sensors and load switches
Sensor DT nodes (`bmp388@76`, `bma580@18`, `bmx160@68`, `mlx90632@3a`,
`maxm86161@62`) declare no `power-domains` property. Combined with the fact that
they're `compatible = "i2c-device"` and have no driver/PM callback, the load-switch
refcount and the sensor's "active" state are coordinated only by the C++ wrappers.
Easy to leak (see 3.5) and easy to introduce ordering bugs.

#### 3.8 `ls_1_8` and `ls_sd` are pinned on for the device's entire lifetime ✅ RESOLVED
`PowerManager::begin()` no longer claims any load switches. `SDCardManager`
owns `ls_1_8` + `ls_sd` for the card-present duration only; when the card is
removed the rails drop.

#### 3.9 Begin-time load-switch enablement is duplicated and order-sensitive ✅ RESOLVED
Gone — all three load-switch DT nodes have `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto`,
so there's no explicit `pm_device_runtime_enable` in `begin()` at all.

### Medium

#### 3.10 `power_down` ordering: sensors are stopped before BLE is disconnected
`shutdown_subsystems()` still runs disconnect → ext-adv-stop →
`stop_sensor_manager()` → stop-watchdog → `dac.end()` without waiting for the
async disconnect events. The 200 ms sleep before `bt_disable()` is the
existing buffer; re-ordering so audio/sensor teardown happens after BLE
teardown is still a latent improvement.

#### 3.11 The `DEBOUNCE_POWER_MS = K_MSEC(1000)` constant is unused at the place that needs it
`PowerManager.h` defines it, but `power_good_callback` schedules
`power_down_work` with `K_NO_WAIT`. So unplugging USB while powered-off triggers
an immediate `power_down`, with no debounce. Not catastrophic but the named
constant is misleading.

#### 3.12 No fault-recovery path for non-undervoltage faults
In `classify_charging`, only BAT_UVLO (bit 5) has a recovery transition (→
PRECHARGING when power is connected and current is flowing). OVP / TS / input-UV
faults fall through to `FAULT` and re-enter it on the next poll with no exit.
The work handler does re-run `setup_pmic()` on a TS fault, which might un-stick
the TS path, but everything else requires a user power-cycle.

### Low / code-quality

#### 3.13 No `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto` on the load-switch nodes ✅ RESOLVED
All three load-switch nodes now have the attribute; `PowerManager::begin()`
doesn't need to enable any of them.

#### 3.14 Synchronous `pm_device_runtime_put` everywhere
Some shutdown paths (especially PPG, which talks to the chip) could use
`pm_device_runtime_put_async` so the suspend completes off the calling thread.
Probably doesn't matter for the rare power-down case but might smooth sensor
reconfiguration.

#### 3.15 Sensors aren't real Zephyr devices
Compatible = `"i2c-device"` means: no `init_fn`, no `pm_action_cb`, no
`PM_DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE`. We're paying the price (manual coordination, no domains,
no auto-runtime, can't piggy-back on system PM) without the benefit (smaller code).
This is a structural choice — converting to real drivers is a larger refactor — but
it's the root cause of half the issues above.

## 4. Likely connections to PROBLEMS.md regressions

`PROBLEMS.md` lists three live regressions. Possible links:

1. **i2c3 sensor dropouts (temp, baro, bone)** — §3.4 is now closed (all
   sensors quiesce before their rail drops) and §3.9 is resolved, so the
   remaining suspects for this regression are bus-level (i2c controller never
   gated, §3.6) or ordering issues during re-acquire, not per-sensor shutdown.

2. **12 s power-on press** — most likely a BQ25120A button-hold-time register
   change. The `Push-button Control` register is 0x08; bits `MRRESET[1:0]` set
   the MR-hold → reset time (00=5s, 01=9s default, 10=11s, 11=15s), and bit
   `MRWAKE2` sets the WAKE2 latch time (0=1000ms, 1=1500ms default). Firmware
   never writes 0x08, so timings sit at reset defaults; a previous firmware
   that felt like "~4s" almost certainly wrote `MRRESET=00`. `PowerManager`
   itself doesn't gate on time — only on the WAKE2 latch.

3. **Bone conductor data loss at 6400 Hz with SD logging** — primarily a CPU /
   bus-contention issue (i2c3 at 1 MHz vs spi4 SD at 32 MHz, both DMA but both
   draining the same RAM). Power-management adjacent only insofar as nothing is
   ever clock-gated, so we run at full power throughout.

---

## 5. Next steps

**Done (Phase 1 of the original plan):**

1. ✅ DTS + Kconfig: `mx25r64` wired into `power-domains`; `CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_POWER_DOMAIN=y`.
2. ✅ KTD2026 claims only `ls_3_3`.
3. ✅ `PowerManager::begin` claims no load switches; all three have `zephyr,pm-device-runtime-auto`.
4. ✅ `SDCardManager`: presence probe in `init()`, rails held only while card is inserted.
5. ✅ MCUmgr DFU hook gets/puts `mx25r64`.
6. ✅ `power_down()`: spurious `led_controller.begin()` removed.
7. ✅ `PPG` GPIO LDO released in `stop()` and the init error path.
8. ✅ BMP388 `sleep()` call before rail cut.
9. ✅ `PowerManager::begin` simplified: no per-reset-reason force-boot gymnastics,
    `check_battery()` is the only gate (see §9 for why).
10. ✅ Power-button state machine that waits for a post-boot release before
     acting on BQ25120A WAKE events (see §8).
11. ✅ USB-plug-while-running triggers a clean `reboot()` so MSC comes up via
     the known-good cold-boot path (see §9).
12. ✅ `reboot()` and `power_down()` share `shutdown_subsystems()`.
13. ✅ BMX160 `IMU::stop()` parks accel+gyro in suspend mode before the rail drops.

**Remaining:**

- **Root-cause USB MSC mid-run failure** — the `reboot()` in §9 is a pragmatic
  fix; the underlying race between running system state and USB MSC attaching
  to the SD disk is not understood (see §10).
- **Consider converting sensors to real Zephyr drivers** with PM action
  callbacks and `power-domains` (§3.15). Big refactor; would eliminate several
  categories of manual refcount bugs.

## 6. Charging code: structure

The charging-related code lives in `src/Battery/PowerManager.{h,cpp}` and
`src/Battery/BQ25120a.{h,cpp}`. A few patterns are load-bearing; grepping for
these names will orient most changes.

### `BQ25120a::ChargePhase` — typed enum for the 2-bit charging-phase field

`enum class ChargePhase : uint8_t { Discharge, Charging, Done, Fault }`. The
register-0x00 `>> 6` shift lives in a single accessor,
`BQ25120a::read_charge_phase()`. Everything that cares about phase (the work
handler's big switch, `get_battery_status` GATT encoding, `cmd_battery_info`)
uses the enum. One diagnostic (`cmd_sensor_diag`) still prints the raw byte
inline — deliberate, because it also dumps the full register for debugging.

### `BQ25120a::ActiveScope` — RAII guard for I2C access to the charger

I2C reads/writes to the BQ25120A require the chip to be out of high-impedance
mode (CD pin low) while the transaction happens. `ActiveScope` is a refcounted
RAII guard with a `k_mutex` that brackets any such access: the 0→1 transition
calls `exit_high_impedance()`, the 1→0 transition calls `enter_high_impedance()`,
and nested/concurrent scopes compose correctly. Call-site usage:

```cpp
{
    BQ25120a::ActiveScope active(battery_controller);
    auto phase = battery_controller.read_charge_phase();
    // ...
}
```

Most sites use the scope. A few exceptions: `PowerManager::begin()` spans ~100
lines of init between a manual `exit_high_impedance()` and `enter_high_impedance()`
because early returns into `power_down()` would dismiss a scope guard at the wrong
time; and `power_down()` itself has a belt-and-suspenders standalone
`enter_high_impedance()` after `set_wakeup_int`. `BQ25120a::setup()` and
`BQ25120a::write_LDO_voltage_control()` use the scope internally.

### `charger_init_pending` — ISR → work-queue handoff for charger re-init

`power_good_callback` runs in GPIO ISR context on USB plug-in/plug-out. I2C can't
run there, so it can't call `setup_pmic()` directly. Instead, on plug-in it sets
`charger_init_pending = true` and schedules the `charge_ctrl_delayable` work
item. `charge_task` (work context) sees the flag, clears it, runs `setup_pmic()`
+ `enable_charge()`, then submits `fuel_gauge_work`. Boot doesn't need to seed
the flag — `begin()` calls `setup_pmic()` once up front.

### `PowerManager::setup_pmic()` — single entry point for charger configuration

All charger-configure paths (`begin()`, `charge_task()` on plug-in,
`fuel_gauge_work_handler` on TS-fault recovery, the `sensor_diag` shell command)
route through `setup_pmic()`. `_battery_settings` is referenced in exactly one
place outside the member declaration. `BQ25120a::setup()` holds its own
`ActiveScope` internally, so `setup_pmic()` adds no extra bracketing.

### `BQ25120a::fault_bits[]` — single source of truth for fault-register labels

A constexpr array of `{mask, name}` pairs for register 0x01 (faults). The work
handler's `LOG_WRN` loop and the shell diag's `shell_print` loop both iterate
this array. Labels follow BQ25120A datasheet Table 13 exactly:
B4=BAT_OCP (cleared on read), B5=BAT_UVLO (persistent), B6=VIN_UV (cleared on
read), B7=VIN_OV (persistent). Heads-up: upstream commit `91d4081` swapped the
B4/B7 names in 2025-05; the swap is fixed here but still lives in upstream.

### `classify_charging()` — pure state classifier

`fuel_gauge_work_handler` separates three concerns:

1. **Read** hardware state into `struct charging_snapshot` (phase, `bat_status`,
   `gauge_status`, fault byte, voltage, current, target current, `power_connected`).
2. **Classify** via file-static pure `classify_charging(snapshot, cfg) → enum
   charging_state`. Zero I/O, no logging, no side effects — unit-testable in
   isolation (no tests written yet).
3. **Side effects** on the result: logging by phase, TS-fault recovery
   (`setup_pmic()`), zbus publish, polling-interval adjustment.

The undervoltage-recovery edge case (BAT_UVLO + power connected + current
flowing → PRECHARGING) is a single branch inside the classifier rather than a
side-effecting hairball in the switch.

### `cmd_battery_info` vs. work-handler LOG_DBG dump

Both print overlapping battery snapshots in slightly different formats. Not
consolidated; a shared formatter taking a `printk`/`shell_print` callback is the
natural next step if fields need to be added. `cmd_battery_info` also prints
the four load-switch pin states (`ls_1_8`, `ls_3_3`, `ls_sd`, PPG LDO) plus
the BQ25120A `EN_LS_LDO` bit.

## 8. Power-button state machine

`PowerManager::begin()` no longer gates boot on BQ25120A button/wake register
bits. The only boot gate is `check_battery()`. The button state machine is a
post-boot polling loop:

```
member: first_release_seen = false      // set once the button is first released

begin() schedules power_button_watch_work with K_MSEC(100)
power_button_watch_handler (k_work_delayable):
    if earable_btn.getState() == BUTTON_RELEASED:
        first_release_seen = true        // consume the power-on press
        return                           // stops polling
    else:
        reschedule(K_MSEC(100))

battery_controller_work_handler (BQ25120A INT → work):
    read button register
    if state.wake_2 && first_release_seen:
        power_on = !power_on
        if (!power_on) power_down()
```

Result: the user can hold the button until they see the desired state change,
release, and that's it. The toggle on WAKE_2 fires immediately (state change is
visible while the button is still held); the `first_release_seen` flag makes
sure the initial power-on press isn't mis-read as an immediate power-off
toggle.

## 9. Reset-reason handling and USB-plug reboot

`begin()` reads `RESETREAS` for **diagnostics only** — it logs the bits and
records `oe_boot_state.timer_reset` on `RESETPIN` wakes (the BQ25120A timer
reset vs a programmer nRESET is still useful downstream) — but the reset
reason does not gate boot. Historically there were four separate
`if (reset_reas & X) power_on = true` blocks plus a charge-wait loop; all gone.

USB-plug while the device is already running is handled by triggering a
graceful reboot instead of trying to bring USB MSC up against running app
state:

```cpp
// power_good_callback (GPIO ISR on BQ25120A PG):
if (power_good && power_manager.power_on) {
    k_work_submit(&usb_plug_reboot_work);   // handler calls power_manager.reboot()
}
```

This ensures the device always comes up via the cold-boot-with-USB path, which
is known to cleanly enumerate the SD card over MSC. On VBUS-wake from
System OFF, the new boot just proceeds normally (no special handling needed).

---

## 10. Known limitation: USB MSC while device is running

`sd_bench` (firmware-side disk access) works reliably with the rails up, but
host-initiated READ(10) requests over USB MSC time out with `DID_ERROR
cmd_age=3s` when USB is plugged into a running device. INQUIRY / READ_CAPACITY
(served from cached `sd_card` fields, no SPI transaction) respond fine; the
failure is specifically on data reads. Root cause not nailed down — suspected
thread/priority contention between the USBD stack and whatever the app is
doing when the host tries to read. Worked around by rebooting on USB plug (§9),
which puts us into the cold-boot path that works end-to-end.
